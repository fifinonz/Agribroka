<p>A middleman is commonly known as a ‘broker’. As the name ‘broker’ suggests, these are individuals who have access to both the farmers and the wholesaler traders who buy their goods. A good middleman will have information on each and every farmer in their locality. The acreage of his/her farm, the crops planted, the expected harvest time and so on. In addition they also have access to current market prices for every major commodity and strong links with other brokers in the farmers markets who sell to processors, institutions, hotels and other wholesale buyers. </p>

<p>Agribroka, a mobile app is being designed to to replace the traditional middleman. By signing up to use the AgriBroka app, a farmer will be in control of what they sell, when they sell it, who they sell to and at how much. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a mobile app that will allow any Kenyan farmers to build a marketing profile for their farms and connect with verified wholesale and retail traders/merchants who will buy their goods at competitive market prices.  The system will use a producer-buyer matching mechanism to fill buyers’ quotas dynamically from available products from farmers within a 10km radius of each other.</p>
